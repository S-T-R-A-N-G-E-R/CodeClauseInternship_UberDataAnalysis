## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Uber transportation data, focusing on aspects such as trip categories, geographical insights, trip distances, purposes, and time-based patterns. The insights gained from this analysis offer valuable understanding and context to the dataset.

## Key Features

- In-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Uber transportation data.
- Uncovering key insights about business trips, geographical focus, short-distance travel, varied trip purposes, and time-based usage patterns.
- Recommendations for enhancing the business user experience, geographical expansion, user engagement, data-driven decision-making, and sustainability initiatives.
- Acknowledgment of project limitations and suggestions for future work.
